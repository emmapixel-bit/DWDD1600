        <h1> The life of an athlete</h1>
<h2>The pressure</h2>
<p>Athletes understand pressure. The pressure to make the shot. The pressure to win the game. But there is also the constant pressure to be more, to do more, to achieve more. It is the nature of the beast, and if they are a competitor which all high-level athletes are they often accept that challenge and dig in. </p><p>This drive for success, however, comes with a toll. Research shows that the mental stress placed on collegiate athletes to continuously achieve more can be overwhelming. A study published in Psychology of Sport and Exercise found that student-athletes experience higher levels of stress than their non-athlete peers, primarily due to the pressure to excel in both their sport and their academics. 

Moreover, the pressure to succeed is compounded by the pervasive culture of perfectionism within collegiate athletics. Athletes are frequently expected to not only meet but exceed expectations. In a study from the Journal of Clinical Sport Psychology, athletes reported feeling an intense need to prove themselves, both on the field and in the classroom, and to maintain a high level of performance, which can lead to chronic stress and anxiety. The internal dialogue of “I need to be the best” can contribute to feelings of inadequacy when performance dips or injuries occur. </p>
<h2>the schedule</h2>
<p>Overall, an athlete’s day may seem to be very simple and strictly tied to routines and schedules, but when looking at a normal day in more detail, the mind is processing surprisingly many factors in order to optimize performance. an athletes schedule might look something like this</p>
<ol>
    <Li>wake up at 7:30, have breakfast (whole grain porridge, jam, bread with ham, cheese and tomatoes). </li> the first training session starts at 9:00. </Li>high-intensity workout, long aerobic workout or strength training for 2 hours, having sports drinks at regular intervals.</li>followed by a recovery drink, shower, maintenance of sports equipment and lunch.</li>an hour to take care of general duties before taking a nap. At 15:00.</li> then starting the next workout</li>The same routines are repeated 7 days a week.</li>
</ol>
